## Getting Started

Download the repository. Navigate to the repo. Run the line:

```
python 2048.python
```

The game is played on a 4-by-4 grid. A dash (-) indicates a blank space. The W-A-S-D keys are used as arrow keys. A directional move will shift all existing numbers as far as possible in that direction. Two identical numbers that collide will add merge and add their value. After each move, a new number (2 or 4) will populate in one of the blank spaces randomly. 

The player loses if all blank spaces fill without winning.

The player wins if any space holds the value 2048.
